House Rent Prediction Dataset



The goal of this project is to build and evaluate multiple regression models for predicting house rent prices using the House Rent Prediction Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as property size, location, furnishing status, number of bathrooms, tenant preferences, and more.

We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with meaningful visualizations, preprocess the data appropriately, and build four regression models:

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

ElasticNet Regression

Evaluation is based on regression metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R² score.
