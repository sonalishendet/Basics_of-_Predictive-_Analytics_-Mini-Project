Heart Failure Prediction — Project Summary

The Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle provides clinical and demographic data to help build a predictive model for heart disease. The objective of this project is to understand the factors contributing to heart disease and develop machine learning models that can accurately predict whether an individual is likely to have heart disease based on health indicators.

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction using clinical data can help medical professionals take preventive or corrective action, improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
